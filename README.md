You are the most idiotic person I have ever seen. Despite the fact that you clearly don't know what the disorder "Autism" means, it's clear you're trying way too hard to sound smart. And you claim you're at a party? Good for you. But why are you wasting your time on ROBLOX messaging when you can ### ###### to the max with the drinks at lie at the table? Either way, I will live a life much more better than the life you claim to live right now. Also, throwing around your ego of yours won't help you with your situation, it shows how ignorant and insignificant you are. Go ahead and run your big ego of yours one last time. You will surely fail in life, and never gain the necessities you need to have a good life. Just to remind you, you're wasting time not ####### ###### and instead talking to me. Have a good New Year, and I will surely live a life that's worth more than the worth you claim your life is. You are truly the only person in my life who I need to watch rot.
